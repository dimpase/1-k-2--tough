Reply to the referee.

We thank the referee for valuable comments.
In the revision we have addressed them all.
In particular, we

* added a proof requested in comment 2.

* fixed the missing case noted in comment 3.

* rewrote the place mentioned in comment 4 so that
 it only used the standard Hall's theorem

* explained why the algorithm in Thm 2 is polynomial;
 indeed, one case needs to be extracted from the proof
 of Theorem 4 in [6]. We feel it suffices to say that
 the polynomiality of the construction is implicit in the proof
 in [6]. Surely, if needed, we can provide an appendix
 with details.
