\title{On $k$-walks in $2K_2$-free graphs}
\begin{abstract}
We show that for any $\epsilon>0$ every $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough
$2K_2$-free graph admits a $k$-walk, making a step towards proving a
long-standing conjecture from \cite{jackson1990k}. The proof uses a
decomposition of $2K_2$-free graphs which might be of independent interest.

\section{Introduction}

Let  $\ncc(G)$ denote the number of connected components of a graph $G$ with vertex set $V:=V(G)$ and edge set $E:=E(G)$. For $S\subset V$, let $G-S$ denote the subgraph of $G$ induced on $V-S$.
%\begin{definition}
$G$ is called $\beta$-{\em tough},
for a real $\beta>0$, if $\ncc(G-S)>1$ implies $|S|\ge \beta\cdot \ncc(G-S)$ 
for each $S\subset V$.
%\end{definition}

That is, a $\beta$-tough 
$G$ cannot be split into $p$ (with $p>1$) components by removing less than
$p\beta$ vertices.  
This concept, a measure of graph connectivity and ``resilience'' under vertex subsets removal,
was introduced in 1973 by V. Chv\'{a}tal 
while studying   Hamiltonicity of graphs. For a survey of results on graph toughness till 2006
cf. \cite{MR2221006}. Our graph-theoretic notation is mostly from \cite{bomu08}.

Let $p*G$ denote the multigraph obtained from $G$ by taking each edge $p$ times. 
A $k$-{\em walk} is a spanning subgraph $W$ of $(2k)*G$, with each vertex of even degree at 
most $2k$.% (the evenness says that $W$ is Eulerian). 
In particular a graph has a 1-walk if and only if it is $K_2$ (i.e. one edge) or Hamiltonian.
In 1990 B.~Jackson and N.~Wormald conjectured \cite{jackson1990k} that for any integer $k\ge2$ a
$\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough graph $G$ admits a $k$-walk.
{For a survey of results on walks in graphs till 2005 cf. \cite{kouider2005connected}.}

In this paper, we prove that this conjecture is ``almost'' true, under the
assumption that $G$ is  $2K_2$-free, that is $G$ does not contain an induced
copy of $2K_2$, i.e. the disjoint union of two edges.  Here by ``almost'' we
mean that we need to replace $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough by
$(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough, with $\epsilon>0$ arbitrarily small.  In fact
$\epsilon$ can be set to 0 for most $2K_2$-free graphs, and the outcome of
Theorem~\ref{thm2} will remain true, cf. Theorem~\ref{opt} below for details.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm2} 
For any $\epsilon>0$, and integer $k\ge2$, every
$(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough $2K_2$-free graph admits a $k$-walk.
\end{theorem}

If we let the toughness value $\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon$ to increase to 
$\frac{1}{k-2}$ then
one does not need $2K_2$-freeness. Indeed, the following holds.
\begin{theorem}\cite{jackson1990k}\label{cthm1}
Every $\frac{1}{k-2}$-tough graph has a $k$-walk. 
In particular every 1-tough graph has a 3-walk. \qed
\end{theorem}
Clearly, if $G$ is
Hamiltonian, then $G$ is 1-tough.  More generally:
\begin{theorem}\cite{jackson1990k}\label{add}
If $G$ has a $k$-walk, then $G$ is $\frac{1}{k}$-tough. \qed
\end{theorem} 
However, the converse is not true already for $k=1$.  

This more or less summarises the situation with $t$-tough graphs, $t\leq 1$.
On the $t>1$ side 
a famous conjecture of V.~Chv\'{a}tal \cite{chvatal1973tough} claims
that there exists a constant $\beta$ such that every
$\beta$-tough graph is Hamiltonian.  

The concept of a $k$-walk is a generalization of the concept of a Hamiltonian cycle.
Ellingham and Zha \cite{ellingham2000toughness} proved that
every 4-tough graph has a 2-walk.

Recently, in \cite{broersma2014toughness}, H.~Broersma, V.~Patel and A.~Pyatkin proved that 
every 25-tough 2$K_2$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian.
Our Theorem~\ref{thm2} was inspired by this result.  
However, our
approach is technically quite different, and, unlike \cite{broersma2014toughness}, we do not seem to be
able to make any good algorithmic conclusions about the problem at hand.
Indeed, the construction relies on finding maximum cliques in
$2K_2$-free graphs, and this is known to be NP-hard. 
To prove Theorem~\ref{thm2}, we first prove
\begin{theorem}\label{thm1}
For any $2K_2$-free graph $G$ the set $V(G)$ 
can be partitioned into three disjoint parts $V(Q_0)$, $V(Q_{\infty})$ and $V(D)$ (some of these parts possibly empty), so that for the corresponding induced subgraphs
$Q_0$, $Q_\infty$, and $D$ the following holds: $Q_0$ is dominating in $G$ and Hamiltonian, 
$Q_{\infty}$ admits a spanning 2-walk with at most one vertex visited more than once, 
and $D$ is a coclique.
\end{theorem}

The following is immediate, by removing an appropriate edge in the 2-walk.
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:2w}
$Q_{\infty}$ admits a spanning path (a.k.a. Hamiltonian path). \qed
\end{corollary}

The terminology just used is standard; we include the following for the sake of
clarity.  A {\em clique} means a complete subgraph, a {\em coclique} means a
induced subgraph containing no edge. For $A=\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}\subseteq V$, a
subgraph $P$ in $G$ with $V(P)=A$ and
$E(P)=\{v_1v_2,v_2v_3,\ldots,v_{m-1}v_m\}$ is called a {\em path}.  For any
$v\in V$, let $v^\perp:=v^{\perp_G}$ denote the union of $\{v\}$ and the set of
neighbors of $v$ in $G$.  More generally, for $A\subset V$, let
$A^\perp:=A^{\perp_G}$ denote the set of vertices {\em dominated} by $A$, i.e.
$A^\perp=\bigcup\limits_{y\in A}v^\perp$, and $A$ is said to be {\em
dominating} if $A^\perp=V$.  It should also lead to no confusion when we talk
about  dominating induced subgraphs $H$ of $G$, in the sense of $V(H)$ being
dominating, respectively a subset of vertices (e.g. set of vertices of a
subgraph) being dominated by $H$, etc.

\section{Properties of $2K_2$-free Graphs and Proof of Theorem \ref{thm1}}
An induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ with $B=V(H)$ (resp. $B\subset V$) is said to be {\em weakly-dominating}
an induced subgraph $F$ (we allow $F=G$ here) 
if for any $v_1v_2\in E(F)$, we have $v_1\in B^\perp$ or $v_2\in B^\perp$.
Further, let $\omega(G)$ denote the maximum size of cliques in $G$. 

\subsection{Properties of $2K_2$-free Graphs}
The following properties of $2K_2$-free graphs are very useful in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm1} and Theorem \ref{thm2}.

\begin{lemma}\label{trivial}
$G$ is $2K_2$-free if and only if each edge in $G$ is weakly-dominating. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm1}{\cite[Theorem 2]{chung1990maximum}, \cite[Lemma 2]{broersma2014toughness}}
Assume that $G$ is $2K_2$-free, $\omega(G)=2$, then $G$ is in one of the following cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G$ is a bipartite.
\item $G$ can be obtained from a five-circle by vertex multiplication. \qed
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm4}
Let $H$ be a connected $2K_2$-free graph with $\omega(F)=2$. 
Then $H$ admits a decomposition into a connected induced subgraph $F$ and a coclique $\Delta$, with $F$ admitting a 2-walk
with at most one vertex visited more than once.
%The subgraph $Q_{\infty}$ admits a spanning path, i.e. a path visiting each vertex in $Q_{\infty}$ exactly once.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
Let $S:=\{S_i\mid 1\leq i\leq  \sigma\}$ be a maximum size matching in $H$.
Denote by $F$ the subgraph spanned by $S$, and
$S_{i}=v_{i,1}v_{i,2}$. As $S$ is maximum, the complement $\Delta$ of $F$ in $H$
is a coclique.

Let $F$ be bipartite, with the parts $\{v_{i,1}\mid i=1,\ldots,\sigma\}$ and $\{v_{i,2}\mid i=1,\ldots,\sigma\}$. 
Denote by $F^t$ the induced subgraph of $F$ containing the first $t$ of the edges $F_i$, i.e. let $V(F^t)=\{v_{i,j}\mid i=1,\ldots,t, \ j=1,2\}$
We proceed by induction on $t$. We shall prove that in $F^t$ there is a spanning path $v'_{1,1}v'_{1,2}v'_{2,1}\cdots v'_{t,1}v'_{t,2}$ and each edge $v'_{p,1}v'_{p,2}$ is 
in $S$.

If $t=1$, then $v_{1,1}v_{1,2}$ is the path we want. Now, we assume that $F^t$ admits a spanning path, namely $v'_{1,1}v'_{1,2}\cdots v'_{t,1}v'_{t,2}$, 
with each $v'_{p,1}v'_{p,2}\in S$, and look at $F^{t+1}$.

For the case $v'_{t,2}v_{t+1,1}\in E(G)$ 
(resp. $v'_{1,1}v_{t+1,2}\in E(G)$)
we get a spanning path 
$v'_{1,1} v'_{1,2}\cdots v'_{t,2} v_{t+1,1} v_{t+1,2}$
(resp. $v_{t+1,1} v_{t+2,2} v'_{1,1} v'_{1,2} v'_{2,1}\cdots v'_{t,2}$)
in $F^{t+1}$.

If $v'_{t,2}v_{t+1,1},v'_{1,1}v_{t+1,2}\not\in E(G)$, from the weak dominance
we get $v'_{t,1}v_{t+1,2}\in E(G)$ and $v'_{1,2}v_{t+1,1}\in E(G)$. Now, we
denote by $q$ the smallest subscript for $v'_{q,1}v_{t+1,2}\in E(G)$. That
means $v'_{q-1,1}v_{t+1,2}\not\in E(G)$. Again, by weak dominance,
we get $v'_{q-1,2}v_{t+1,1}\in E(G)$. Thus we get a spanning path in
$F^{t+1}$, namely $$v'_{1,1}\cdots
v'_{q-1,2}v_{t+1,1}v_{t+1,2}v'_{q,1}\cdots v'_{t,2}.$$

Thus, by induction, $F$ has a spanning path, staring at $u_1\in V(F)$ and
ending at $u_{2\sigma}\in V(F)$. %, with all the edges in $S$ in the path.

If $\sigma=1$ then $F$ admits a 1-walk.
and we are done (in the bipartite case).

Now we can assume $\sigma\geq 2$.
If $u_1u_{2\sigma}\in E(F)$ then $F$ is
Hamiltonian, and we are done. 
if we have both $u_1$ and $u_{2\sigma}$ adjacent to non-intersecting edges in $E(H)-E(F)$, 
then we have a contradiction, as $S$ is not maximum.
if we have both $u_1$ and $u_{2\sigma}$ adjacent to  $u\in V(H)-V(F)$, 
then we add $u$ to $F$ and remove it from $\Delta$, obtaining
a Hamiltonian $F$.
Thus we can assume that $u_1$ is not adjacent to  $V(H)-V(F)$, 
while $u_{2\sigma}$ may be adjacent to  $V(H)-V(F)$. 


Now we complete the case $\sigma=2$. 
If there are no edges in $E(H)-E(F)$ adjacent to $u_4$, 
we add $u_1$ and $u_4$ to $\Delta$ and remove them from $F$. 
The resulting $F$ is an edge, and thus has a 1-walk.\\
It remains, without loss in generality,
to consider the case where there exist $u_5$ so that only $u_4$ is adjacent to 
$u_4u_5\in E(H)-E(F)$, and $u_1$ is not
adjacent to $u_4$. As $u_1u_2$ wealky dominates $u_4u_5$, we have that $u_2$ must be 
adjacent to $u_5$. 
We set $F$ to be the subgraph induced by
$u_2,\dots,u_5$, remove $u_5$ from $\Delta$, and add $u_1$ to $\Delta$; then $F$ is Hamiltonian, and we are done.

To finish off the bipartite case it remains to consider $\sigma\geq 3$.
As $u_1u_2$ weakly dominates $u_{2\sigma-1}u_{2\sigma}$, then $u_2u_{2\sigma-1}\in E(F)$, 
otherwise $F$ is
non-bipartite (for adjacent $u_2$ and $u_{2\sigma}$ or $u_1$ and $u_{2\sigma-1}$).
As $u_1$ is not adjacent to   $V(H)-V(F)$, we add it to $\Delta$ and remove from $F$,
obtaining $F$ with a 2-walk where only $u_{2\sigma-1}$ is visited twice. 


\medskip

It remains to consider a non-bipartite $F$. By Lemma \ref{lm1},
$F$ can be obtained from a 5-circle by ``vertex multiplication''. We
denote $V(F)=V_0\cup \dots \cup V_4$, and
$E(F)=E_0\cup \dots \cup E_4$, where each $V_i$ is an
independent set, and  for any $a\in V_i$ and $b\in V_{i+1}$ we have $ab\in E_i$. 
Here and below we always take the indices of $v_i$, $E_i$, etc. modulo $5$.
We denote
$E'=\{v_{j,1}v_{j,2}\mid 1\leq j\leq \sigma\}$, and $E'_i=E_i\cap E'$ (recall that $v_{j,1}v_{j,2}$
comprise $S_{j})$). 
Obviously,
$|V_i|=|E'_{i-1}|+|E'_i|$. Note $|V_i|>0$ for $0\leq i\leq 4$, otherwise
$F$ is bipartite. Thus $|E'_i|+|E'_{i-1}|>0$ for any $0\leq i\leq 4$. 
Without loss of generality, we can assume $|E'_0||E'_2||E'_4|>0$.
Note that $E'_1$ and $E'_3$ can be empty.

$V_i$ is partitioned into
$V_i^-:= V_i\cap V(E'_{i-1})$ and 
$V_i^+:= V_i\cap V(E'_{i})$. For each $\Sigma:=E'_i\neq\emptyset$ there is
a path $\Pi_i$ connecting its vertices in $V_i$ and in $V_{i+1}$, 
as follows: $u_1 w_1 u_2\dots u_{|\Sigma|}w_{|\Sigma|}$, with 
$u_k\in V_i^+$ and $w_k\in V_{i+1}^-$.%\footnote{If we wish we can choose $u_k w_k$ to be
%a $Q_{m+j}$.} 
Note that there is an edge joining the last vertex of $\Pi_i$ and
the first vertex of $\Pi_{i+2}$. Thus it makes sense to talk about the path
$\Pi_i\Pi_{i+2}$, which joins $V_i^+$, $V_{i+1}^-$, $V_{i+2}^+$ and
$V_{i+3}^-$.

In the case of both $E'_1$ and $E'_3$ nonempty, we observe that 
$\Pi_0\Pi_2\Pi_4\Pi_1\Pi_3$ is a Hamiltionian cycle, as the end of
$\Pi_3$ is adjacent to the beginning of $\Pi_0$. 
If $E'_3=\emptyset$  
we use instead the path 
$\Pi_4\Pi_1\overline{\Pi}_2\Pi_0$, where $\overline{\Pi}_2$
denotes $\Pi_2$ taken backwards, to obtain a Hamiltonian
cycle.

if $E'_1\cup E'_3=\emptyset$ 
we can take the Hamiltonian path $\Pi_0\Pi_2\Pi_4$, 
which begins and ends at $V_0$. Denote the first
edge of this path by $ab$ and the last vertex of it 
by $c$. As $c\in V_0$ and $b\in V_1$, they are adjacent.
Thus we have a 2-walk in $F$, where only $b$ is visited
twice.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}\label{lm2}{\cite[Theorem 3]{chung1990maximum}}
If $G$ is $2K_2$-free with $\omega(G)\ge3$, then $G$ has a dominating clique of size $\omega(G)$. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm3}{\cite[Observation 1]{broersma2014toughness}}
A graph $G=(V,E)$ is $2K_2$-free if and only if for every $A\subset V$, at most one component of the graph $G-A$ contains edges. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm5}
In a $2K_2$-free graph $G=:G_0$, there exists a sequence of cliques
$Q_i\subseteq G_{i-1}$ of size at least $2$, cocliques $D_i\subseteq G_{i-1}$
with $V(Q_i)\cap V(D_i)=\emptyset$,  
and connected subgraphs $G_{i}:=(G_{i-1}-Q_{i})-D_{i}$, with
no edges between $D_i$ and $G_i$,  for
$i=1,\ldots,m+s$, where
$|Q_i|\ge3$ for $1\le i\le m$ and $|Q_i|=2$ for $i=m+1,\ldots,m+s$.
Moreover, $|Q_i|\ge|Q_{i+1}|$ for any $i$, $Q_i$ is a maximum
(respectively, weakly-) dominating
clique in $G_{i-1}$ for $1\leq i\leq m$ (respectively, for $i>m$).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We construct the claimed sequences of $Q_i$, $D_i$, 
and $G_i$ directly by induction, as follows. 
We may assume that $G_i$ is $2K_2$-free.
If $\omega(G_i)\ge3$ then by Lemma \ref{lm2}, it contains a 
maximum dominating clique $Q_{i+1}$.
Otherwise it is triangle-free, and any edge $Q_{i+1}$ is weakly-dominating
in $G_i$.
As any induced subgraph of a $2K_2$-free
graph is also $2K_2$-free, $G_i-Q_{i+1}$ is also a $2K_2$-free graph.
By Lemma \ref{lm3}, $G_i-Q_{i+1}$ is made of two parts, one is a coclique
(possibly empty) $D_{i+1}$, and the other is a connected
component (either empty or with a least two vertices) $G_{i+1}$, which is also
$2K_2$-free (again, as an induced subgraph of a $2K_2$-free graph).
Thus from $G_i$ we have constructed $Q_{i+1}$, $D_{i+1}$, and $G_{i+1}$
with the  claimed properties.
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}\label{lm6}
The vertex set of a $2K_2$-free graph $G$ can be divided into three disjoint, 
possibly empty, parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V(Q_0)=\cup_{i=1,\ldots,m}V(Q_i).$\label{Vq0}
\item $V(Q_{\infty})=\cup_{i=m+1,\ldots,m+s}V(Q_i).$\label{Vqinfty}
\item $V(D)=\cup_{i=1,\ldots,m+s}V(D_i)$\label{Vd}
\end{enumerate}
Here, $Q_0$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(Q_0)$, $Q_{\infty}$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(Q_{\infty})$ and $D$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(D)$. 
Denote $V(Q)=V(Q_0)\cup V(Q_{\infty})$, where $Q$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(Q)$. 
\end{definition}
Note that obviously $V(G)=V(Q)\cup V(D)$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lmDcoclique}
$D$ is a coclique in $G$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lm5}, there are no edges between $D_i$ and $G_i$. By constructuon, 
$D_j$, for $j>i$, lies in $G_i$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$.}
Now we look at the behavior of the cliques of size $2$ in the sequence $\{Q_i\}$. Note that
we might need to modify its tail, starting from $i=m+1$.

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm1}}
Let $G_m$ be as constructed in Lemma~\ref{lm5}. Applying Theorem~\ref{thm4} to it, 
we obtain $Q_\infty:=F$ and $D:=D_i\cup\Delta$. 
By Lemma \ref{lmDcoclique} and Theorem \ref{thm4}, we only need to prove that $Q_0$ is Hamiltonian.
Below we prove this, and a bit more, needed later for the proof of the main result.

Let $\{Q_i\}$ and $m$ be as defined in Lemma \ref{lm5}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:twoQ}
Let $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ so that $i<j$ and $|Q_i|\geq 3$.
Then for any $a_j b_j\in E(Q_j)$  there is $a_i b_i\in E(Q_i)$ satisfying
$a_i a_j, b_i b_j\in E$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $ab\in E(Q_j)$. As $Q_i$ dominates $Q_j$, in $Q_i$ there is a vertex adjacent to 
$a$ and a vertex adjacent to $b$.
We claim that on the other hand $a$ and $b$ are adjacent to at least $|Q_i|-1$ vertices in $Q_i$. 
Indeed, if there were $c\neq d\in V(Q_i)$ adjacent neither to $a$ nor to $b$, 
then $ab$ and $cd$ would form a $2K_2$.
As $|Q_i|-1\ge 2$, we can choose $cd\in E(Q_i)$ such that $ac, bd\in E$.
\end{proof}
 
Theorem \ref{thm1} is immediate from the first part of the following.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:Q0H}
The graph $Q_0$ is Hamiltonian. 
For any $v\in V(Q_1)$ and $w\in V(Q_m)$ there exists a Hamiltonian
path in $Q_0$ with endpoints $v$ and $w$.
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof}
If $m=0$, then $Q_0$ does not exist, and there is nothing to prove.\\
If $m=1$, i.e. $Q_0=Q_1$, then obviously $Q_0$ is Hamiltonian, since it is just a clique, and
has a Hamiltonian path joining any two vertices.\\
If $m=2$, i.e. $V(Q_0)=V(Q_1)\cup V(Q_2)$, then by Lemma~\ref{lem:twoQ} 
for a $ab\in E(Q_2)$
we can find $cd\in E(Q_1)$ so that $ac,~bd\in E(G)$. 
Note that we can assume $w\neq a$, $w\neq b$, as $|V(Q_s)|\geq 3$.
There exists a Hamiltonian path in  $Q_1$ (respectively in $Q_2$) 
with endpoints $c$, $d$ (respectively $a$, $b$).
These two paths and $ac$ and $bd$ form a Hamiltonian cycle.
Without loss in generality, $c\neq v$. Hence we can construct a
Hamiltonian path in $Q_0$ by concatenating a $Q_1$-Hamiltonian
path $cv$, the  edge $av$, and a $Q_2$-Hamiltonian path $wa$.
 
It remains to deal with $m\geq 3$.
Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:twoQ} to $Q_{i-1}$ and $Q_i$ for each $2\leq i\leq m$, 
we construct $a_{i-1}a_i, b_{i-1}b_i\in E$ joining $Q_{i-1}$ and $Q_i$.
Select a half of them, namely $a_{m}a_{m-1}$, $b_{m-1}b_{m-2}$, $a_{m-2}a_{m-3}$, \dots,
$a_2a_1$ in the case $m$ even (respectively, $b_2b_1$ for $m$ odd).

Next, construct an edge between $Q_m$ and $Q_1$, avoiding vertices of the edges just
selected, i.e. $a_m\in V(Q_m)$ and $x\in V(Q_1)$. 
This can be done by applying Lemma~\ref{lem:twoQ} to $Q_m$, $Q_1$, 
and $a,b\in V(Q_m)-\{a_m\}$ to obtain $a'b'\in E(Q_1)$ so that $aa',bb'\in E$, 
noticing that either $aa'$ or $bb'$ will be as needed. Say, for $m$ even 
it is $aa'$
that satisfies $a'\neq a_1$, (respectively, $a'\neq b_1$ for $m$ odd)  and we 
abuse notation by denoting $b_m:=a$ and $b_1:=a'$ (respectively for $m$ odd 
we denote $a_1:=a'$).

Finally, we construct Hamiltonian paths in each $Q_i$ joining the pairs of vertices
$a_i,b_i\in V(Q_i)$ just constructed, obtaining the required Hamiltonian cycle.

To prove the second part of the lemma for $m\geq 3$, observe that we can choose
$w\neq a_m$, $w\neq b_m$. Without loss in generatity we can assume that $v\neq a_1=:a$ 
for $m$ even (resp. $v\neq b_1=:a$ for $m$ odd), 
and proceed to construct the Hamiltonian path
which first goes from $w$ to $a_m$ in $Q_m$, then goes the same way as the Hamiltonian
path we just constucted to $a$, and then joins $a$ and $v$ in $Q_1$ by a Hamiltonian path 
in the latter.
\end{proof}

\section{The Proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}}



The $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-toughness condition with $\epsilon>0$ 
is only used for the dominating cliques sequence $\{Q_i\}$ 
and parameters $m$ and $s$, as defined in Lemma \ref{lm5},
in the case $m=1$ and $s\geq 1$. Namely, we prove the following
slightly stronger
\begin{theorem}\label{opt}
Let $G$ be a connected $2K_2$-free graph.
If $G$ is $\left(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon\right)$-tough, for an
$\epsilon>0$, then $G$ admits a $k$-walk. 
Moreover, a $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough $G$ admits a $k$-walk if either
$m\ge2$, or if $G$ is {\em split}, i.e. $m=1$, $s=0$.  
\end{theorem}




The following lemma is the key technique in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}.

\begin{lemma}\label{addtec}
Let $V(G)$ have a partition $V(G)=V(Q)\cup V(D)$, 
so that the induced subgraph $D$ is a coclique.
\begin{enumerate} 
\item If the induced subgraph $Q$ is Hamiltonian 
and $G$ is $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough, 
then $G$ admits a $k$-walk.\label{itone}
\item If the induced subgraphs $Q$ admits a 2-walk, 
where only one vertex $v_{\infty}$ is visited twice in the walk 
and all other vertices are visited once, and $G$ is $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough, then $G$ admits a $k$-walk.\label{ittwo}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $D_0\subset D$.
For part (\ref{itone}), 
by $\frac{1}{k-1}$-toughness, 
$D_0$ has at least $\left\lceil\frac{|D_0|}{k-1}\right\rceil$ neighbors in $Q$. By Hall's Theorem, 
there is $E'\subset E(G)$ such that each $e\in E'$ has one vertex in $D$ and the other in $Q$,
and each vertex in $D$ is incident to exactly one edge in $E'$, while each vertex in $Q$ is incident to at most $k-1$ edges in $E'$.
Then these ({doubled}) edges in $E'$ and the edges in the Hamiltonian cycle $H$ of $Q$ form a $k$-walk in $G$.

For part (\ref{ittwo}), by $\left(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon\right)$-toughness, 
$D_0$ has at least $\left\lceil(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)|D_0|\right\rceil$ neighbors in $Q$. 
Split each vertex in $Q$ into $k-1$ copies and denote the set of all the split vertices by $Q^{k-1}$. 
Then $D_0$ has at least $(k-1)\lceil(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)|D_0|\rceil\ge|D_0|+1$ neighbours in $Q^{k-1}$. 
Pick one copy of $v_{\infty}$, namely $v^*\in Q^{k-1}$. Then $D_0$ has at least $|D_0|$ neighbours 
in $Q^{k-1}-\{v^*\}$. Thus by Hall's Theorem there is a matching from $D$ to $Q^{k-1}-\{v^*\}$. 
Now collapse these copies back to $Q$. Each vertex in $D$ is incident to exactly one edge from the resulting matching $E'$. 
Each vertex in $Q-\{v_{\infty}\}$ takes at most $k-1$ edges from $E'$,
while $v_{\infty}$ takes at most $k-2$ edges from $E'$. 
Then $2*E'$ and the edges from the 2-walk in $Q$ form a $k$-walk in $G$.
\end{proof}


It follows from Lemma~\ref{addtec} and Theorem~\ref{thm4} that
if a $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough $G$ is triangle-free, i.e. $\omega(G)=2$, then 
it admits a $k$-walk.

\subsection{The case $m\ge1$} 
Now we can assume $|Q_1|\ge3$.
By Lemma \ref{addtec}, we only need to prove that the induced subgraph $Q$ on the vertex set $V(Q)=V(Q_0)\cup V(Q_{\infty})$ is Hamiltonian when $m\ge2$, 
respectively, admits a 2-walk, with only one vertex $Q_{\infty}$ visited at most twice, and all other vertices visited exactly once, when $m=1$.)

Let $G$ be a $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough $2K_2$-free graph, for some $\epsilon>0$. The sequence of cliques defined in Lemma \ref{lm5} is $\{Q_1,\ldots,Q_m,\ldots,Q_{m+s}\}$, where $|Q_i|\ge3$, for $1\le i\le m$ and $|Q_i|=2$ for $m+1\le i\le m+s$. Additionally, $Q_i$ dominates $Q_j$ for $i\le m$ and $i<j$; $Q_i$ weakly dominates $Q_j$ for $m<i<j$. And $Q_{\infty}$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on all the vertices of $Q_i$, $i>m$, as defined in Lemma \ref{lm6}. 

\subsubsection{When $s=0$}
We have $Q=Q_0$, since $Q_{\infty}$ does not exist. Then by Theorem \ref{thm1}, $Q$ is Hamiltonian.
 
Let $s\geq 1$. Corollary~\ref{cor:2w} provides 
a spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$, say $u_1\cdots u_{2s}$. 

\subsubsection{When $m\ge2$}
As each vertex in $Q_{\infty}$ is dominated by each clique $Q_i$, for $1\le i\le m$, we
can find $v\in Q_1$ and $w\in Q_m$ such that
$u_1v,~u_{2s}w\in E(G)$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:Q0H}, there is a Hamiltonian path in $Q_0$
 $v\cdots w$. Joining it to $u_1\cdots u_{2s}$, we obtain a Hamiltonian cycle in $Q$.
 
\subsubsection{$m=1$}
If $u_1$ and $u_{2s}$ have two different neighbors in $Q_1$, say $u_1v_1,~u_{2s}v_2\in E(G)$, where $v_1,~v_2\in Q_1$, then we can pick up a spanning path in $Q_1$ with $v_1$ and $v_2$ as two endpoints. Then connect the spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$ and the spanning path in $Q_1$ together, we get a Hamiltonian cycle in $Q$.

If $u_1$ and $u_2$ are adjacent to only one vertex, say $v_{\infty}$ in $Q_1$, then we can find a Hamilton cycle in $Q_1$ and the two endpoints of the spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$ is connected to $v_{\infty}$ and come into a 2-walk in $Q$, with $v_{\infty}$ visited twice and all other vertices visited once. 
\qed



At last we pose two conjectures to finish this paper:


\begin{conjecture}
Every $3/2$-tough $2K_2$-free graph on at least three vertices has a 2-trail, i.e. a 2-walk with each edge appearing in the walk at most once.
\end{conjecture}


\begin{conjecture}
Every 2-tough $2K_2$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian.
\end{conjecture}
