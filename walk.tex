\title{On $k$-walks in $2K_2$-free graphs}
\begin{abstract}
We show that for any $\epsilon>0$ every $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough
$2K_2$-free graph admits a $k$-walk, making a step towards proving a
long-standing conjecture from \cite{jackson1990k}. The proof uses a
decomposition of $2K_2$-free graphs which might be of independent interest.

\section{Introduction}

Let  $\ncc(G)$ denote the number of connected components of a graph $G$ with vertex set $V:=V(G)$ and edge set $E:=E(G)$. For $S\subset V$, let $G-S$ denote the subgraph of $G$ induced on $V-S$.
\begin{definition}
$G$ is called $\beta$-{\em tough},
for a real $\beta>0$, if $\ncc(G-S)>1$ implies $|S|\ge \beta\cdot \ncc(G-S)$ 
for each $S\subset V$.
\end{definition}
That is, a $\beta$-tough 
$G$ cannot be split into $p$ (with $p>1$) components by removing less than
$p\beta$ vertices.  
This concept, a measure of graph connectivity and ``resilience'' under vertex subsets removal,
was introduced in 1973 by V. Chv\'{a}tal 
while studying   Hamiltonicity of graphs. For a survey of results on graph toughness till 2006
cf. \cite{MR2221006}. Our graph-theoretic notation is mostly from \cite{bomu08}.

In 1990 B.~Jackson and N.~Wormald conjectured \cite{jackson1990k} that every
$\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough graph $G$ admits a $k$-walk, i.e. a sequence of edges
visiting each vertex at least once and at most $k$-times, for any integer $k\ge2$. 
{For a survey of results on walks in graphs till 2005 cf. \cite{kouider2005connected}.}

In this paper, we prove that this conjecture is ``almost'' true, under the
assumption that $G$ is  $2K_2$-free, that is $G$ does not contain an induced
copy of $2K_2$, i.e. the disjoint union of two edges.  Here by ``almost'' we
mean that we need to replace $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough by
$(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough, with $\epsilon>0$ arbitrarily small.  In fact
$\epsilon$ can be set to 0 for most $2K_2$-free graphs, and the outcome of
Theorem~\ref{thm2} will remain true, cf. Theorem~\ref{opt} below for details.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm2} 
For any $\epsilon>0$, and integer $k\ge2$, every
$(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough $2K_2$-free graph admits a $k$-walk.
\end{theorem}

If we let the toughness value $\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon$ to increase to 
$\frac{1}{k-2}$ then
one does not need $2K_2$-freeness. Indeed, the following holds.
\begin{theorem}\cite{jackson1990k}\label{cthm1}
Every $\frac{1}{k-2}$-tough graph has a $k$-walk. 
In particular every 1-tough graph has a 3-walk. \qed
\end{theorem}
Clearly, if $G$ is
Hamiltonian, then $G$ is 1-tough.  More generally:
\begin{theorem}\cite{jackson1990k}\label{add}
If $G$ has a $k$-walk, then $G$ is $\frac{1}{k}$-tough. \qed
\end{theorem} 
However, the converse is not true already for $k=1$.  

This more or less summarises the situation with $t$-tough graphs, $t\leq 1$.
On the $t>1$ side 
a famous conjecture of V.~Chv\'{a}tal \cite{chvatal1973tough} claims
that there exists a constant $\beta$ such that every
$\beta$-tough graph is Hamiltonian.  

The concept of a $k$-walk is a generalization of the concept of a Hamiltonian cycle.
Ellingham and Zha \cite{ellingham2000toughness} proved that
every 4-tough graph has a 2-walk.

Recently, in \cite{broersma2014toughness}, H.~Broersma, V.~Patel and A.~Pyatkin proved that 
every 25-tough 2$K_2$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian.
Our Theorem~\ref{thm2} was inspired by this result.  
However, our
approach is technically quite different, and, unlike \cite{broersma2014toughness}, we do not seem to be
able to make any good algorithmic conclusions about the problem at hand.
Indeed, the construction relies on finding maximum cliques in
$2K_2$-free graphs, and this is known to be NP-hard. 
To prove Theorem~\ref{thm2}, we first prove
\begin{theorem}\label{thm1}
For any $2K_2$-free graph $G$ the set $V(G)$ 
can be partitioned into three disjoint parts $V(Q_0)$, $V(Q_{\infty})$ and $V(D)$ (some of these parts possibly empty), so that for the corresponding induced subgraphs
$Q_0$, $Q_\infty$, and $D$ the following holds: $Q_0$ is dominating in $G$ and Hamiltonian, 
$Q_{\infty}$ admits a spanning path (also called Hamiltonian path), 
and $D$ is a coclique.
\end{theorem}

The terminology just used is standard; we include the following for the sake of
clarity.  A {\em clique} means a complete subgraph, a {\em coclique} means a
induced subgraph containing no edge. For $A=\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}\subseteq V$, a
subgraph $P$ in $G$ with $V(P)=A$ and
$E(P)=\{v_1v_2,v_2v_3,\ldots,v_{m-1}v_m\}$ is called a {\em path}.  For any
$v\in V$, let $v^\perp:=v^{\perp_G}$ denote the union of $\{v\}$ and the set of
neighbors of $v$ in $G$.  More generally, for $A\subset V$, let
$A^\perp:=A^{\perp_G}$ denote the set of vertices {\em dominated} by $A$, i.e.
$A^\perp=\bigcup\limits_{y\in A}v^\perp$, and $A$ is said to be {\em
dominating} if $A^\perp=V$.  It should also lead to no confusion when we talk
about  dominating induced subgraphs $H$ of $G$, in the sense of $V(H)$ being
dominating, respectively a subset of vertices (e.g. set of vertices of a
subgraph) being dominated by $H$, etc.

\section{Properties of $2K_2$-free Graphs and Proof of Theorem \ref{thm1}}
An induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ with $B=V(H)$ (resp. $B\subset V$) is said to be {\em weakly-dominating}
an induced subgraph $F$ (we allow $F=G$ here) 
if for any $v_1v_2\in E(F)$, we have $v_1\in B^\perp$ or $v_2\in B^\perp$.
Further, let $\omega(G)$ denote the maximum size of cliques in $G$. 

\subsection{Properties of $2K_2$-free Graphs}
The following properties of $2K_2$-free graphs are very useful in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm1} and Theorem \ref{thm2}.

\begin{lemma}\label{trivial}
$G$ is $2K_2$-free if and only if each edge in $G$ is weakly-dominating. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm1}{\cite[Theorem 2]{chung1990maximum}, \cite[Lemma 2]{broersma2014toughness}}
Assume that $G$ is $2K_2$-free, $\omega(G)=2$, then $G$ is in one of the following cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G$ is a bipartite.
\item $G$ can be obtained from a five-circle by vertex multiplication. \qed
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm2}{\cite[Theorem 3]{chung1990maximum}}
If $G$ is $2K_2$-free with $\omega(G)\ge3$, then $G$ has a dominating clique of size $\omega(G)$. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm3}{\cite[Observation 1]{broersma2014toughness}}
A graph $G=(V,E)$ is $2K_2$-free if and only if for every $A\subset V$, at most one component of the graph $G-A$ contains edges. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm5}
In a $2K_2$-free graph $G=:G_0$, there exists a sequence of cliques
$Q_i\subseteq G_{i-1}$ of size at least $2$, cocliques $D_i\subseteq G_{i-1}$
with $V(Q_i)\cap V(D_i)=\emptyset$,  
and connected subgraphs $G_{i}:=(G_{i-1}-Q_{i})-D_{i}$, with
no edges between $D_i$ and $G_i$,  for
$i=1,\ldots,m+s$, where
$|Q_i|\ge3$ for $1\le i\le m$ and $|Q_i|=2$ for $i=m+1,\ldots,m+s$.
Moreover, $|Q_i|\ge|Q_{i+1}|$ for any $i$, $Q_i$ is a maximum
(respectively, weakly-) dominating
clique in $G_{i-1}$ for $1\leq i\leq m$ (respectively, for $i>m$).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We construct the claimed sequences of $Q_i$, $D_i$, 
and $G_i$ directly by induction, as follows. 
We may assume that $G_i$ is $2K_2$-free.
If $\omega(G_i)\ge3$ then by Lemma \ref{lm2}, it contains a 
maximum dominating clique $Q_{i+1}$.
Otherwise it is triangle-free, and any edge $Q_{i+1}$ is weakly-dominating
in $G_i$.
As any induced subgraph of a $2K_2$-free
graph is also $2K_2$-free, $G_i-Q_{i+1}$ is also a $2K_2$-free graph.
By Lemma \ref{lm3}, $G_i-Q_{i+1}$ is made of two parts, one is a coclique
(possibly empty) $D_{i+1}$, and the other is a connected
component (either empty or with a least two vertices) $G_{i+1}$, which is also
$2K_2$-free (again, as an induced subgraph of a $2K_2$-free graph).
Thus from $G_i$ we have constructed $Q_{i+1}$, $D_{i+1}$, and $G_{i+1}$
with the  claimed properties.
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}\label{lm6}
The vertex set of a $2K_2$-free graph $G$ can be divided into three disjoint, 
possibly empty, parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V(Q_0)=\cup_{i=1,\ldots,m}V(Q_i).$\label{Vq0}
\item $V(Q_{\infty})=\cup_{i=m+1,\ldots,m+s}V(Q_i).$\label{Vqinfty}
\item $V(D)=\cup_{i=1,\ldots,m+s}V(D_i)$\label{Vd}
\end{enumerate}
Here, $Q_0$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(Q_0)$, $Q_{\infty}$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(Q_{\infty})$ and $D$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(D)$. 
Denote $V(Q)=V(Q_0)\cup V(Q_{\infty})$, where $Q$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(Q)$. 
\end{definition}
Note that obviously $V(G)=V(Q)\cup V(D)$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lmDcoclique}
$D$ is a coclique in $G$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lm5}, there are no edges between $D_i$ and $G_i$. By constructuon, 
$D_j$, for $j>i$, lies in $G_i$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$.}
Now we look at the behavior of the cliques of size $2$ in the sequence $\{Q_i\}$.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm4}
The subgraph $Q_{\infty}$ admits a spanning path, i.e. a path visiting each vertex in $Q_{\infty}$ exactly once.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
Denote $Q_{m+i}=v_{i,1}v_{i,2}$ for $i=1,\ldots,s$.
Let $Q_{\infty}$ be bipartite, with the parts $\{v_{i,1}\mid i=1,\ldots,s\}$ and $\{v_{i,2}\mid i=1,\ldots,s\}$. 


Denote by $Q^t_{\infty}$ the induced subgraph of $Q_{\infty}$ containing the first $t$ of the edges $\{Q_{m+i}\mid i=1,\ldots,s\}$, i.e. let $V(Q^t_{\infty})=\{v_{i,j}\mid i=1,\ldots,t, \ j=1,2\}$
We proceed by induction on $t$. We shall prove that in $Q^t_{\infty}$, $(t=1,\ldots,s)$, there is a spanning path $v'_{1,1}v'_{1,2}v'_{2,1}\cdots v'_{t,1}v'_{t,2}$ and each edge $v'_{p,1}v'_{p,2}$ is 
of the form $Q_{m+q}=v_{q,1}v_{q,2}$.


If $t=1$, then $v_{1,1}v_{1,2}$ is the path we want. Now, we assume that $Q^t_{\infty}$ admits a spanning path, namely $v'_{1,1}v'_{1,2}\cdots v'_{t,1}v'_{t,2}$, with each $v'_{p,1}v'_{p,2}=v_{q,1}v_{q,2}$ for some $q$, and look at $Q^{t+1}_{\infty}$.

For the case $v'_{t,2}v_{t+1,1}\in E(G)$ 
(resp. $v'_{1,1}v_{t+1,2}\in E(G)$)
we get a spanning path 
$v'_{1,1} v'_{1,2}\cdots v'_{t,2} v_{t+1,1} v_{t+1,2}$
(resp. $v_{t+1,1} v_{t+2,2} v'_{1,1} v'_{1,2} v'_{2,1}\cdots v'_{t,2}$)
in $Q^{t+1}_{\infty}$.

If $v'_{t,2}v_{t+1,1},v'_{1,1}v_{t+1,2}\not\in E(G)$, from the weak dominance
we get $v'_{t,1}v_{t+1,2}\in E(G)$ and $v'_{1,2}v_{t+1,1}\in E(G)$. Now, we
denote $q$ the smallest subscript for $v'_{q,1}v_{t+1,2}\in E(G)$. That
means $v'_{q-1,1}v_{t+1,2}\not\in E(G)$. Again, by weak dominance,
we get $v'_{q-1,2}v_{t+1,1}\in E(G)$. Thus we get a spanning path in
$Q^{t+1}_{\infty}$, namely $$v'_{1,1}\cdots
v'_{q-1,2}v_{t+1,1}v_{t+1,2}v'_{q,1}\cdots v'_{t,2}.$$

Thus, by induction, $Q_{\infty}$ has a spanning path.%, with all the edges $Q_{m+i},i=1,\ldots,s$ in the path.

\medskip

It remains to consider a non-bipartite $Q_{\infty}$. By Lemma \ref{lm1},
$Q_{\infty}$ can be obtained from a 5-circle by ``vertex multiplication''. We
denote $V(Q_{\infty})=V_0\cup \dots \cup V_4$, and
$E(Q_{\infty})=E_0\cup \dots \cup E_4$, where each $V_i$ is an
independent set, and  for any $a\in V_i$ and $b\in V_{i+1}$ we have $ab\in E_i$. 
Here and below we always take the indices of $v_i$, $E_i$, etc. modulo $5$.
We denote
$E'=\{v_{j,1}v_{j,2}\mid 1\leq j\leq s\}$, and $E'_i=E_i\cap E'$ (recall that $v_{j,1}v_{j,2}$
comprise $V(Q_{m+j})$). Obviously,
$|V_i|=|E'_{i-1}|+|E'_i|$. Note $|V_i|>0$ for $0\leq i\leq 4$, otherwise
$Q_{\infty}$ is bipartite. Thus $|E'_i|+|E'_{i-1}|>0$ for any $0\leq i\leq 4$. 
Without loss of generality, we can assume $|E'_0||E'_2||E'_4|>0$.
Note that $E'_1$ and $E'_3$ can be empty.

$V_i$ is partitioned into
$V_i^-:= V_i\cap V(E'_{i-1})$ and 
$V_i^+:= V_i\cap V(E'_{i})$. For each $\Sigma:=E'_i\neq\emptyset$ there is
a path $\Pi_i$ connecting its vertices in $V_i$ and in $V_{i+1}$, 
as follows: $u_1 w_1 u_2\dots u_{|\Sigma|}w_{|\Sigma|}$, with 
$u_k\in V_i^+$ and $w_k\in V_{i+1}^-$.%\footnote{If we wish we can choose $u_k w_k$ to be
%a $Q_{m+j}$.} 
Note that there is an edge joining the last vertex of $\Pi_i$ and
the first vertex of $\Pi_{i+2}$. Thus it makes sense to talk about the path
$\Pi_i\Pi_{i+2}$, which joins $V_i^+$, $V_{i+1}^-$, $V_{i+2}^+$ and
$V_{i+3}^-$.

In the case of both $E'_1$ and $E'_3$ nonempty, we observe that 
$\Pi_0\Pi_2\Pi_4\Pi_1\Pi_3$ is a Hamiltionian path we need.
If $E'_3=\emptyset$  we omit $\Pi_3$; if in addition $E'_1=\emptyset$ 
we omit $\Pi_1$, too. Finally, in the case  $E'_1=\emptyset$ and 
$E'_3\neq\emptyset$ we can take $\Pi_3\Pi_0\Pi_2\Pi_4$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remarks}
\textcolor{red}{From the proof, we see, if $|E'_1||E'_3|>0$, then the two endpoints of the path, $\Pi_0\Pi_2\Pi_4\Pi_1\Pi_3$, are adjacent in $G$, i.e. $Q_{\infty}$ is Hamiltonian.}
\end{remarks}

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm1}}
By Lemma \ref{lmDcoclique} and Theorem \ref{thm4}, we only need to prove that $Q_0$ is Hamiltonian.
Let $\{Q_i\}$ and $m$ be as defined in Lemma \ref{lm5}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:twoQ}
Let $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ so that $i<j$ and $|Q_i|\geq 3$.
Then for any $a_j b_j\in E(Q_j)$  there is $a_i b_i\in E(Q_i)$ satisfying
$a_i a_j, b_i b_j\in E$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $ab\in E(Q_j)$. As $Q_i$ dominates $Q_j$, in $Q_i$ there is a vertex adjacent to 
$a$ and a vertex adjacent to $b$.
We claim that on the other hand $a$ and $b$ are adjacent to at least $|Q_i|-1$ vertices in $Q_i$. 
Indeed, if there were $c\neq d\in V(Q_i)$ adjacent neither to $a$ nor to $b$, 
then $ab$ and $cd$ would form a $2K_2$.
As $|Q_i|-1\ge 2$, we can choose $cd\in E(Q_i)$ such that $ac, bd\in E$.
\end{proof}
 
If $m=0$, then $Q_0$ does not exist, and there is nothing to prove.\\
If $m=1$, i.e. $Q_0=Q_1$, then obviously $Q_0$ is Hamiltonian, since it is just a clique.\\
If $m=2$, i.e. $V(Q_0)=V(Q_1)\cup V(Q_2)$, then by Lemma~\ref{lem:twoQ} 
for a $ab\in E(Q_2)$ 
we can find $cd\in E(Q_1)$ so that $ac,~bd\in E(G)$. 
There exists a Hamiltonian path in  $Q_1$ (respectively in $Q_2$) 
with endpoints $c$, $d$ (respectively $a$, $b$).
These two paths and $ac$ and $bd$ form a Hamiltonian cycle.

It remains to treat the case $m\geq 3$.
Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:twoQ} to $Q_{i-1}$ and $Q_i$ for each $2\leq i\leq m$, 
we construct $a_{i-1}a_i, b_{i-1}b_i\in E$ joining $Q_{i-1}$ and $Q_i$.
Select a half of them, namely $a_{m}a_{m-1}$, $b_{m-1}b_{m-2}$, $a_{m-2}a_{m-3}$, \dots,
$a_2a_1$ in the case $m$ even (respectively, $b_2b_1$ for $m$ odd).

Next, construct an edge between $Q_m$ and $Q_1$, avoiding vertices of the edges just
selected, i.e. $a_m\in V(Q_m)$ and $x\in V(Q_1)$. 
This can be done by applying Lemma~\ref{lem:twoQ} to $Q_m$, $Q_1$, 
and $a,b\in V(Q_m)-\{a_m\}$ to obtain $a'b'\in E(Q_1)$ so that $aa',bb'\in E$, 
noticing that either $aa'$ or $bb'$ will be as needed. Say, for $m$ even 
it is $aa'$
that satisfies $a'\neq a_1$, (respectively, $a'\neq b_1$ for $m$ odd)  and we 
abuse notation by denoting $b_m:=a$ and $b_1:=a'$ (respectively for $m$ odd 
we denote $a_1:=a'$).

Finally, we construct Hamiltonian paths in each $Q_i$ joining the pairs of vertices
$a_i,b_i\in V(Q_i)$ just constructed, obtaining the required Hamiltonian cycle, 
and completing the proof of Theorem \ref{thm1}.

\section{The Proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}}

For an integer $p$, let $p*G$ denote the multigraph obtained from $G$ by taking each edge $p$ times. 
Thus a $k$-walk is a spanning subgraph $W$ of $(2k)*G$, with each vertex of even degree at 
most $2k$ (the evenness says that $W$ is Eulerian). 


The $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-toughness condition with $\epsilon>0$ 
is only used for the dominating cliques sequence $\{Q_i\}$ 
and parameters $m$ and $s$, as defined in Lemma \ref{lm5},
in the case $m=1$ and $s\geq 1$. Namely, we prove the following
slightly stronger
\begin{theorem}\label{opt}
Let $G$ be a connected $2K_2$-free graph.
If $G$ is $\left(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon\right)$-tough, for an
$\epsilon>0$, then $G$ admits a $k$-walk. 
Moreover, a $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough $G$ admits a $k$-walk if either
$m\ge2$, or if $G$ is {\em split}, i.e. $m=1$, $s=0$.  
\end{theorem}




The following lemma is the key technique in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}.

\begin{lemma}\label{addtec}
Let $V(G)$ have a partition $V(G)=V(Q)\cup V(D)$, 
so that the induced subgraph $D$ is a coclique.
\begin{enumerate} 
\item If the induced subgraph $Q$ is Hamiltonian 
and $G$ is $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough, 
then $G$ admits a $k$-walk.\label{itone}
\item If the induced subgraphs $Q$ admits a 2-walk, 
where only one vertex $v_{\infty}$ is visited twice in the walk 
and all other vertices are visited once, and $G$ is $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough, then $G$ admits a $k$-walk.\label{ittwo}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $D_0\subset D$.
For part (\ref{itone}), 
by $\frac{1}{k-1}$-toughness, 
$D_0$ has at least $\left\lceil\frac{|D_0|}{k-1}\right\rceil$ neighbors in $Q$. By Hall's Theorem, 
there is $E'\subset E(G)$ such that each $e\in E'$ has one vertex in $D$ and the other in $Q$,
and each vertex in $D$ is incident to exactly one edge in $E'$, while each vertex in $Q$ is incident to at most $k-1$ edges in $E'$.
Then these ({doubled}) edges in $E'$ and the edges in the Hamiltonian cycle $H$ of $Q$ form a $k$-walk in $G$.

For part (\ref{ittwo}), by $\left(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon\right)$-toughness, 
$D_0$ has at least $\left\lceil(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)|D_0|\right\rceil$ neighbors in $Q$. 
Split each vertex in $Q$ into $k-1$ copies and denote the set of all the split vertices by $Q^{k-1}$. 
Then $D_0$ has at least $(k-1)\lceil(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)|D_0|\rceil\ge|D_0|+1$ neighbours in $Q^{k-1}$. 
Pick one copy of $v_{\infty}$, namely $v^*\in Q^{k-1}$. Then $D_0$ has at least $|D_0|$ neighbours 
in $Q^{k-1}-\{v^*\}$. Thus by Hall's Theorem there is a matching from $D$ to $Q^{k-1}-\{v^*\}$. 
Now collapse these copies back to $Q$. Each vertex in $D$ is incident to exactly one edge from the resulting matching $E'$. 
Each vertex in $Q-\{v_{\infty}\}$ takes at most $k-1$ edges from $E'$,
while $v_{\infty}$ takes at most $k-2$ edges from $E'$. 
Then $2*E'$ and the edges from the 2-walk in $Q$ form a $k$-walk in $G$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Triangle-free case, i.e. $m=0$}
Now, we first look at the triangle-free case.

\begin{theorem}\label{trifree}
If $G$ is triangle-free, i.e. $\omega(G)=2$, then $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough implies a $k$-walk.
\end{theorem}




\begin{proof}
As the definition before, $G$ has a weakly-dominating sequence $\{Q_1,\ldots,Q_s\}$, where $|Q_i|=2$.

{\bf Case 1.} If $s=1$, then obviously, $Q_1$ is dominating, since after deleting $Q_1$, there is only a set $D$ of isolated vertices.
By "triangle-free", each vertex $v\in D$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $Q_1$. By $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough, each vertex in $Q_1$ is adjacent to at most $k-2$ vertices in $D$. Then we can draw the $k$-walk easily.

{\bf Case 2.} If $s=2$, then $V(G)=V(Q)\cup V(D)$, where $Q$ admits a path $u_1u_2u_3u_4$, while $D$ is a coclique.


If $u_1$ is adjacent to $u_4$, then $Q$ is hamiltonian, then by Lemma \ref{addtec}, there is a k-walk.

Now we assume $u_1$ is not adjacent to $u_4$.
By triangle-free, $u_1$ is not adjacent to $u_3$, and $u_2$ is not adjacent to $u_4$. Thus $Q$ is the path with no other edges.

If each vertex $v\in D$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $Q$, then by $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough, $u_1$ (or $u_4$) is adjacent to at most $k-2$ vertices in $D$, while $u_2$ (or $u_3$) is adjacent to at most $k-3$ vertices in $D$. Then we can find the $k$-walk easily.

Now we assume there are some vertices in $D$ who are adjacent to at least two vertices in $Q$.
By triangle-free, they are not allowed to be adjacent to two successive vertices in $Q$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item assume $v_0\in D$ is adjacent to $u_1$ and $u_4$, then denote $Q'=Q\cup\{v_0\}$ and $D'=D-\{v_0\}$. Then $V(G)=V(Q')\cup V(D')$ while $Q'$ is hamiltonian and $D'$ is a coclique. Then by $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough, we can find the $k$-walk easily.
\item assume $v_0\in D$ is adjacent to $u_1$ and $u_3$, ($u_2$ and $u_4$ case is similar), then denote $Q'=Q\cup\{v_0\}$ and $D'=D-\{v_0\}$. Then $V(G)=V(Q')\cup V(D')$ while $D'$ is a coclique. Now look at $Q'$, $Q'$ is a cycle $u_1u_2u_3v_0$ and a suspended edge $u_3u_4$, so $Q'$ is a 2-walk, where $u_1$, $u_2$, $u_4$, $v_0$ are visited once and $u_3$ is visited twice. Now we consider $u_3$ as the role of $v_{\infty}$ in Lemma \ref{addtec}, then we can find the $k$-walk with the assumption $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Case 3.} If $s\ge3$, then $V(G)=V(Q)\cup V(D)$, and we require the sequence $\{Q_1,\ldots,Q_s\}$ has the maximum length possible. We know that $Q$ admits a path namely $u_1u_2\cdots u_{2s}$.

If both of $u_1$ and $u_{2s}$ have neighbors in $D$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $v_0\in D$ is adjancent to both $u_1$ and $u_{2s}$, then $Q'=Q\cup\{v_0\}$ is hamiltonian and $D'=D-\{v_0\}$ is a coclique. Then we can find the $k$-walk by Lemma \ref{addtec}.
\item if there are $v_1\neq v_2$ in $D$, where $v_1u_1,~v_2u_{2s}\in E(G)$, then we can find a longer sequence namely $Q'_1=v_1u_1$, $Q'_2=u_2u_3$,\ldots, $Q'_{s+1}=u_{2s}v_2$ in $G$. Contradition with the assumption.
\end{enumerate}

Now, we only consider the situation that at most one in $u_1$ and $u_{2s}$ has neighbors in $D$. Assume that $u_{2s}$ has {\bf no} neighbor in $D$.

Consider the $2K_2$-free condition with $u_1u_2$ and $u_{2s-1}u_{2s}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $u_1u_{2s}\in E(G)$, then $Q$ is hamiltonian, then we can easily find the k-walk in $G$
\item if $u_1u_{2s-1}\in E(G)$, then $Q$ is 2-walk, with $u_{2s-1}$ playing the role of "$v_{\infty}$".
\item if $u_2u_{2s}\in E(G)$, then $Q$ is a 2-walk, with $u_2$ playing the role of "$v_{\infty}$".
\item if $u_2u_{2s-1}\in E(G)$, then denote $Q'=Q-\{u_{2s}\}$, $D'=D\cup \{u_{2s}\}$. Recall the assumption that $u_{2s}$ has no neighbor in $D$, so $D'$ is a coclique, and $Q'$ is the 2-walk, with $u_2$ playing the role of $v_{\infty}$. Then we can find the $k$-walk we want.
\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}


















\subsection{When $m\ge1$} 



We have already solved the case where $G$ is triangle-free in Theorem \ref{trifree}. So, we always assume $|Q_1|\ge3$ in the following proof.

By Lemma \ref{addtec}, we only need to proof the induced subgraph $Q$ on the vertex set $V(Q)=V(Q_0)\cup V(Q_{\infty})$ is Hamiltonian when $m\ge2$, (admits 2-walk, with only one vertex $Q_{\infty}$ visited at most twice, and all other vertices visited exactly once, when $m=1$.)

Let $G$ be a $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough $2K_2$-free graph, for some $\epsilon>0$. The sequence of cliques defined in Lemma \ref{lm5} is $\{Q_1,\ldots,Q_m,\ldots,Q_{m+s}\}$, where $|Q_i|\ge3$, for $1\le i\le m$ and $|Q_i|=2$ for $m+1\le i\le m+s$. Additionally, $Q_i$ dominates $Q_j$ for $i\le m$ and $i<j$; $Q_i$ weakly dominates $Q_j$ for $m<i<j$. And $Q_{\infty}$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ on all the vertices of $Q_i$, $i>m$, as defined in Lemma \ref{lm6}. 

\subsubsection{When $s=0$}
When $s=0$, we have $Q=Q_0$, since $Q_{\infty}$ does not exist. Then by Theorem \ref{thm1}, $Q$ is Hamiltonian, and by Lemma \ref{addtec}, $G$ admits a $k$-walk, under the assmuption $G$ is $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough.
 

\subsubsection{When $m\ge2$, $s\ge1$}
Denote a spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$ as $u_1\cdots u_{2s}$. Because each vertex in $Q_{\infty}$ is dominated by each clique $Q_i$, for $1\le i\le m$, we can find $v_{1,1}\in Q_1$ and $v_{m,1}\in Q_m$ such that $u_1v_{1,1},~u_{2s}v_{m,1}\in E(G)$. Now, let us find a spanning path in $Q_m$, starting with $v_{m,1}$. Obviously, such a path exists since $Q_m$ is a clique. Denote such a path as $v_{m,1}\cdots v_{m,|Q_m|}$. 

We know that $Q_m$ is dominated by $Q_{m-1}$, then there is a vertex, namely $v_{m-1,1}$ adjacnet to $v_{m,|Q_m|}$, again, we can find a spanning path in $Q_{m-1}$, namely $v_{m-1,1}\cdots v_{m-1,|Q_{m-1}|}$. 

Repeat such process, in $Q_2$, we find a vertex $v_{2,1}$ adjacent to $v_{3,|Q_3|}$. Because $|Q_2|\ge3$, then there are at least two other vertices, besides $v_{2,1}$ in $Q_2$, namely $v_{2,a}$ and $v_{2,b}$. In $Q_1$, there are at least two vertices, besides $v_{1,1}$, namely $v_{1,c}$ and $v_{1,d}$. By $2K_2$-free condition, we can assume that $v_{2,a}v_{1,c}\in E(G)$. Then we pick up a spanning $v_{2,1}\cdots v_{2,a}$ in $Q_2$, and a spanning path $v_{1,1}\cdots v_{1,c}$ in $Q_1$. Then all these paths are connected together into a Hamilton cycle in $Q$.


\subsubsection{$m=1$, $s\ge1$}

Again, denote the spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$ as $u_1\cdots u_{2s}$.
If $u_1$ and $u_{2s}$ have two different neighbors in $Q_1$, say $u_1v_1,~u_{2s}v_2\in E(G)$, where $v_1,~v_2\in Q_1$, then we can pick up a spanning path in $Q_1$ with $v_1$ and $v_2$ as two endpoints. Then connect the spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$ and the spanning path in $Q_1$ together, we get the Hamilton cycle in $G$.

If $u_1$ and $u_2$ are adjacent to only one vertex, say $v_{\infty}$ in $Q_1$, then we can find a Hamilton cycle in $Q_1$ and the two endpoints of the spanning path in $Q_{\infty}$ is connected to $v_{\infty}$ and come into a 2-walk, with $v_{\infty}$ visited twice and all other vertices visited once. Then by Lemma \ref{addtec}, we deduce the $k$-walk from the assumption that $G$ is $(\frac{1}{k-1}+\epsilon)$-tough.

At last we pose two conjectures to finish this paper:


\begin{conjecture}
Every $3/2$-tough $2K_2$-free graph on at least three vertices has a 2-trail, i.e. a 2-walk with each edge appearing in the walk at most once.
\end{conjecture}


\begin{conjecture}
Every 2-tough $2K_2$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian.
\end{conjecture}
