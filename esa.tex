\begin{abstract}
We show that an edge-dominating cycle in a $2K_2$-free graph can be found
in polynomial time; this implies that every $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough
$2K_2$-free graph admits a $k$-walk, and it can be found in polynomial time.
For this class of graphs, this proves a
long-standing conjecture due to Jackson and Wormald (1990).
Furthermore, we prove that every $(1+\epsilon)$-tough $2K_2$-free graph is prism-Hamiltonian,
along with few other similar results.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
A graph $G$ is called $\beta$-{\em tough}, for a real $\beta>0$, if for any $p\geq 2$ it
cannot be split into $p$ components by removing less than $p\beta$ vertices.  
This concept, a measure of graph connectivity and ``resilience'' under vertex subsets removal,
was introduced in 1973 by Chv\'{a}tal \cite{chvatal1973tough},
while studying   Hamiltonicity of graphs. For a survey of results on graph toughness till 2006
see \cite{MR2221006}. 

In general, toughness of a graph is NP-hard to compute 
\cite{MR1074858}. Considerable work went into investigating the problem for
various classes of graphs. In particular, recently, Broersma, Patel and Pyatkin proved
\cite{broersma2014toughness} that toughness of a $2K_2$-free graph, i.e. a graph that
does not contain an induced copy of the disjoint union of two edges,
can be found in polynomial time. 

$2K_2$-free graphs are an interesting 
class from algorithmic complexity point of view; most classical algorithmic problems for them are
hard, with a notable exception of the maximum weighted independent set problem 
\cite{balasyu1989}, \cite[Graphclass: $2K_2$-free]{isgci}. In particular 
Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete already for a subclass of $2K_2$-free graphs, 
the {\em split} graphs---graphs for which the set of vertices can be partitioned into
a clique and an independent set \cite[Exercise 6.2]{Golum}.
Due to the latter,  for $2K_2$-free graphs it makes sense to study computational complexity 
of concepts which are generalisations of the Hamiltonian cycle 
problem, such as $k$-walk.

Let $p\times G$ denote the multigraph obtained from $G$ by taking each edge $p$ times. 
A $k$-{\em walk} is a spanning subgraph $W$ of $2k\times G$, such that each vertex of $W$ 
has even degree at most $2k$. % (the evenness says that $W$ is Eulerian). 
In particular a graph has a $1$-walk if and only if it is $K_2$ (i.e. one edge) or Hamiltonian.
{For a survey of results on walks in graphs till 2005 cf. \cite{kouider2005connected}.}
In 1990 B.~Jackson and N.~Wormald conjectured \cite{jackson1990k} that for any integer $k\ge2$ a
$\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough graph $G$ admits a $k$-walk.

In this paper, we prove that Jackson and Wormald's Conjecture is true under the
assumption that $G$ is  $2K_2$-free.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm2} 
For any integer $k\ge2$, every $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough $2K_2$-free graph $G$
admits a $k$-walk.
Moreover, the latter can be found in time polynomial in $|V(G)|$.
\end{theorem}

If for $k\geq 2$ we let the toughness value $\frac{1}{k-1}$ increase to
$\frac{1}{k-2}$ then
one does not need $2K_2$-freeness. Indeed, it is shown in
\cite{jackson1990k} that
every $\frac{1}{k-2}$-tough graph has a $k$-walk.

Clearly, if $G$ is
Hamiltonian, then $G$ is 1-tough.  More generally,
If $G$ has a $k$-walk, then $G$ is $\frac{1}{k}$-tough \cite{jackson1990k}.
However, the converse is not true already for $k=1$ (there even exist $2$-tough graphs which are
not Hamiltonian, cf. \cite{bauer2000not}).

This more or less summarises the situation with $t$-tough graphs, $t\leq 1$.
On the $t>1$ side 
a famous conjecture of V.~Chv\'{a}tal \cite{chvatal1973tough} claims
that there exists a constant $\beta$ such that every
$\beta$-tough graph is Hamiltonian.  
Towards this, 
M.~Ellingham and X.~Zha \cite{ellingham2000toughness} proved that
every 4-tough graph has a 2-walk (cf. Theorem~\ref{thm1} below).

It was recently shown \cite{broersma2014toughness} that 
every 25-tough 2$K_2$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian.
Our Theorem~\ref{thm2} was inspired by this result.  
However, our approach is technically quite different. 

\medskip 

Our next result concerns a structure that is half-way between 1- and 2-walks. 
The {\em prism} over a graph $G$ is the Cartesian product 
\begin{wrapfigure}[6]{r}{.3\textwidth}

$G\square K_2$ of $G$ with the complete graph $K_2$. 
$G$ is called 
{\em prism-Hamiltonian} if $G\square K_2$ is Hamiltonian. 
If $G$ is Hamiltonian, then $G\square K_2$ is also Hamiltonian, but the converse does not hold in general, 
cf. \cite{kaiser2007hamilton}. 
As well, this property is stronger than having a $2$-walk: cf. figure on the right, where
we have a 
$2K_2$-free graph with  a $2$-walk, but without Hamiltonian prism.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm1}
Every $(1+\epsilon)$-tough $2K_2$-free graph $G$ is prism-Hamiltonian, for any $\epsilon>0$.
Moreover, a Hamiltonian cycle in the prism over $G$ can be found in time polynomial in $|V(G)|$.
\end{theorem}

It is worth mentioning that the toughness constant in Theorem~\ref{thm1} is much better
than $\frac{3}{2}$, the lower bound on toughness of a $2K_2$-free graph needed
for its Hamiltonicity, see \cite[Sect.~4]{broersma2014toughness}.

To prove Theorem~\ref{thm2} and Theorem \ref{thm1}, we first prove
\begin{theorem}\label{addgen1} 
Let $G$ be a $2K_2$-free graph. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G$ admits an edge-dominating cycle (or an edge, or a vertex) $C$; 
\item if $G$ contains a triangle, then $G$ admits 
an edge-dominating cycle $C$, with three successive vertices on $C$ forming a triangle in $G$. 
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, $C$ can be found in time polynomial in $|V(G)|$.
\end{theorem}

In fact, in 1983 Veldman \cite{veldman83} has proved the existence of
edge-dominating cycles for $2K_2$-free graphs. However, his proof is based on
contraposition, so it neither tells how to find $C$ in (1), nor
allows to restrict $C$ as in (2).

In the remainder of the paper we provide the proofs, and then discuss related 
open questions.


\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{addgen1}}

\subsection{The proof of the first part of Theorem \ref{addgen1}}
If $G$ is a tree, then, as it is $2K_2$-free, it must either have an edge-dominating
vertex, or an edge-dominating edge.
Otherwise, $G$ has a cycle, say $C=x_1x_2\cdots x_kx_1$, where $k\ge3$.
If $C$ is edge-dominating, then we are done. 
Otherwise
there must be an edge $v_1v_2$ (assume there are $t>0$ such edges), 
with neither $v_1$ nor $v_2$ is on $C$. 
Since $G$ is $2K_2$-free, $v_1$ and $v_2$ have at least two distinct neighbours on $C$. 
Let $x_1v_1\in E(G)$ without loss of generality; 
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $x_2v_1\in E(G)$, then $C'=x_1v_1x_2x_3\cdots x_kx_1$ is a longer cycle;
\item if $x_2v_2\in E(G)$, then $x_1v_1v_2x_2x_3\cdots x_kx_1$ is a longer cycle; 
\item if $x_2v_1,x_2v_2\not\in E(G)$, then applying $2K_2$-freeness to $v_1v_2$ and $x_2x_3$, 
we get either $x_3v_1\in E(G)$ or $x_3v_2\in E(G)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $x_3v_2\in E(G)$, then $C'=x_1v_1v_2x_3\cdots x_kx_1$ is a longer cycle;
\item if $x_3v_2\not\in E(G)$, then $x_3v_1\in E(G)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $x_2$ is adjacent to no vertex outside $C$, then use $C'=x_1v_1x_3\cdots x_kx_1$ instead of $C$. 
We know that $C$ and $C'$ have the same length, but $C'$ dominates all the edges who are dominated by $C$, and $C'$ also dominates $v_1v_2$, who is not dominated by $C$. So replacing $C$ by $C'$
decreases $t$.
\item Otherwise $x_2$ is adjacent to a vertex outside $C$, say $z$.
As $x_2$ is not adjacent to $v_1$ or $v_2$, we have $z$ adjacent to either $v_1$ or $v_2$. If $zv_1\in E(G)$, then $C'=x_1v_1zx_2x_3\cdots x_kx_1$ is a longer cycle.
Otherwise $C'=x_1v_1v_2zx_2x_3\cdots x_kx_1$ is a longer cycle.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Repeat the process above. At each iterarion either $|V(C)|$ increases, or $t$ decreseas.
Thus the process will stop, with $t=0$, in at most $|E(G)|^2$ steps. 
\qed

\subsection{The proof of the second part of Theorem  \ref{addgen1}}
The algorithmic procedure for the second part is almost the same, needing only a minor
modification described below.

Let $G$  contain a triangle $w_1w_2w_3$.
If $w_1w_2w_3$ is edge-dominating, then there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, there is an edge, namely $u_1u_2\in E(G)$, with neither $u_1$ nor $u_2$  on $w_1w_2w_3$. Then, by the $2K_2$-freeness, we can connect $w_1w_2w_3$ and $u_1u_2$ together, to get a 5-cycle $C$, 
with $w_1$, $w_2$ and $w_3$ successive (the order is possibly changed). 

If $C$ is edge-dominating, then we are done. Otherwise, we proceed by induction on
$k:=|V(C)|$. 
Suppose $G$ contains a cycle $C$ of length $|V(C)|=k\ge5$, and there are three successive vertices on $C$, namely $X'$, $X$ and $X''$ forming a triangle in $G$. If $C$ is not edge-dominating. 
We claim that then we can find a cycle $C'$ such that $C'$ dominates more edges than $C$ (perhaps all), 
and $X'$, $X$ and $X''$ are also successive on $C'$.

Let $v_1v_2\in E(G)G$ such that neither $v_1$ nor $v_2$ is on $C$. By $2K_2$-freeness, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are adjacent to at least two of $\{X,X',X''\}$, and thus to at least one of $\{X',X''\}$. Suppose,
without loss of generality, that $v_1X'\in E(G)$; label the vertices in $C$ in the following way:
$X'$ is labeled by $x_1$. The neighbour of $x_1$ on $C$ distinct from $X$ is labeled by $x_2$. 
The other vertices on $C$ are labeled successively, see Figure \ref{labelcycle}.

\caption{The cycle $C$ of length $k$}\label{labelcycle}
\end{figure}

Note that for $k\geq 5$ the operation 
in the proof of the first part of Theorem \ref{addgen1}) 
of replacing  $C$ by $C'$ (enlarging $|V(C)|$ or reducing $t$) 
does not touch the edges $x_{k-1}x_k$ and $x_kx_1$. Thus the triangle-forming 
vertices $X''$, $X$ and $X'$ are always successive on $C$ in our process. 
Then they are on the edge-dominating cycle we obtain there.  \qed


\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}}


Combining Theorem \ref{addgen1} and the following
Lemma \ref{addtec}, we obtain Theorem \ref{thm2}.

\begin{lemma}\label{addtec}
Let $k\geq 2$.
If $G$ has an edge-dominating cycle $C$ (or an edge, or a vertex) 
and if $G$ is $\frac{1}{k-1}$-tough then $G$ admits a $k$-walk.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
The induced subgraph $D=G-C$ is a coclique. For any
$D_0\subset D$, by $\frac{1}{k-1}$-toughness, $D_0$ has at least
$\lceil\frac{|D_0|}{k-1}\rceil$ neighbours in $C$. By Hall' Theorem, there is
$E'\subset E(G)$ such that each $e\in E'$ has one vertex in $D$ and the other
in $C$. As well, each vertex in $D$ is incident to exactly one edge in $E'$, while
each vertex in $C$ is incident to at most $k-1$ edges in $E'$. Then the
(doubled) edges in $E'$ and the edges in the edge-dominating cycle 
(respectively, the doubled edge) $C$ form a $k$-walk in $G$.  
\end{proof}

%\medskip
%
%Now, let us state a related conjecture, to close this section.
%\begin{conjecture}
%Every $3/2$-tough $2K_2$-free graph with at least 3 vertices has a 2-trail, i.e. a 2-walk with each edge appearing in the walk at most once.
%\end{conjecture}


\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm1}}
The following lemma is the key technique in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm1}.
\begin{lemma}\label{keylem}
Let $G$ be $(1+\epsilon)$-tough, for some $\epsilon>0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $G$ contains an edge-dominating cycle $C$ with even number of vertices, then the prism over $G$ is Hamiltonian.
\item If $G$ contains an edge-dominating cycle $C=v_1v_2\cdots v_{2p+1}v_1$ of odd length, and there are three vertices $v_1$, $v_{2q}$ and $v_{2q+1}$, for some $1\le q\le p$, inducing a triangle in $G$, then the prism over $G$ is Hamiltonian.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For the first part (see Figure~\ref{fig:evenprism}), 
denote $C=v_1v_2\cdots v_{2p}v_1$. The set 
$D=V(G)-V(C)$ of vertices outside $C$
is an independent set. By Hall's Theorem and 1-toughness, there is a matching $M$, from $D$ to $C$. That means for any vertex $u_j$ in $D$, there is a vertex $v_{i_j}$ on $C$ adjacent to $u_j$ in $M$.

Obviously, we have a Hamilton cycle in $\bar{C}$, the prism over $C$, namely $$v_1v'_1v'_2v_2\cdots v_{2p-1}v'_{2p-1}v'_{2p}v_{2p}v_1.$$ Now, we change every  $v_{i_j}v'_{i_j}$ (or $v'_{i_j}v_{i_j}$) into $v_{i_j}u_ju'_jv'_{i_j}$ (or $v'_{i_j}u'_ju_jv_{i_j}$) to get a Hamilton cycle in $\bar{G}$.

\end{figure}


For the second part, denote $C=v_1v_2\cdot v_{2p+1}v_1$ (see Figure \ref{fig2}). 
The set $D=V(G)-V(C)$ of vertices outside $C$
is an independent set. By Hall's Theorem, and $(1+\epsilon)$-toughness, 
there is a matching $M$ from $D$ to $C-\{v_1\}$.  That means for any vertex $u_j$ in $D$, 
there is a vertex $v_{i_j}$ in $C-\{v_1\}$ adjacent to $u_j$ in $M$.

Clearly, we have a Hamilton cycle in $\bar{C}$, namely $$v_1v_2v'_2v'_3v_3\cdots v_{2q-1}v_{2q}v'_{2q}v'_1v'_{2q+1}v_{2q+1}\cdots v_{2p+1}v_1.$$
Now, we change every  $v_{i_j}v'_{i_j}$ (or $v'_{i_j}v_{i_j}$) into $v_{i_j}u_ju'_jv'_{i_j}$ (or $v'_{i_j}u'_ju_jv_{i_j}$) to get a Hamilton cycle in $\bar{G}$.

Now, suppose $G$ is a triangle-free $2K_2$-free graph. By \cite[Theorem 4]{broersma2014toughness},
if $|V(G)|\geq 3$ then 
$G$ is Hamiltonian, and so prism-Hamiltonian.
If $|V(G)|=2$, i.e. $G$ a single edge, and ovbiously prism-Hamilton.
Finally, if $2K_2$-free graph $G$ is not triangle-free then we are done by 
Theorem \ref{addgen1} (2) and Lemma \ref{keylem}.

\section{Concluding remarks}

Lemma \ref{addtec} can be used to prove existence of 2-walks in wider than 
$2K_2$-free classes of graphs.
For instance, it is immediate from \cite[Corollary 3.2]{veldman83} that each 2-connected
$3K_2$-free graph admits  an edge-dominating cycle. From the latter and Lemma \ref{addtec},
it is easy to obtain the following.
\begin{theorem}\label{2w3k2f}
Let $G$ be a 1-tough $3K_2$-free graph. Then $G$ admits a 2-walk. \qed
\end{theorem}

It would be interesting to find whether Theorem~\ref{2w3k2f} and similar results
of this type can be made
effective. Towards this end, we would like to propose the following
\begin{conjecture}
Let $\ell\geq 2$ be a fixed constant. 
Then for the $\ell-1$-connected $\ell K_2$-free
graphs there is a polynomial time algorithm finding an edge-dominating cycle.
\end{conjecture}

Of independent interest would be making more general results from \cite{veldman83}, 
in particular Theorem~3, see below, algorithmic. 
\begin{theorem}
{\rm \cite[Theorem~3]{veldman83}.} Let $G$ be an $\ell-1$-connected graph such that
for every induced $\ell K_2$-subgraph $H$ of $G$ one has the
sum of degrees of vertices in $H$ at least $\frac{(\ell-1)(|V(G)-\ell +1)}{2}$.
Then $G$ has  an edge-dominating cycle. \qed
\end{theorem}
